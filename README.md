### Reimplement PointPillar on KITTI Test and GEM Autonomous Vehicle

3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving, robotics, and computer vision applications. It aims to identify and locate objects in 3D space using various sensor data, such as LiDAR point clouds, images, or depth maps. Accurate and efficient 3D object detection is crucial for the safe and effective operation of autonomous systems, as it provides essential information for decision-making, path planning, and navigation. In this project, we reimplement the PointPillars algorithm to realize 3D object detection based on PyTorch. Recognition types include vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. In the experimental part, the algorithm is tested on the GEM vehicle and KITTI dataset.
